### architecture suite

* **[complete-hybrid-network-lab](./complete-hybrid-network-lab)** - contains technical build data, including infrastructure configurations, networking topologies, and security policy sets.
* **[enterprise-design-authority](./enterprise-design-authority)** - contains high-level strategy documents, engineering blueprints, and proof-of-concept (poc) validation results.
* **[packet-life-forensics](./packet-life-forensics)** - contains binary evidence, packet captures (pcaps), and documentation regarding the forensic analysis of network traffic.
