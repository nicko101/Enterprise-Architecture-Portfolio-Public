# enterprise-hybrid-architecture-portfolio

this repository represents a **fully functional enterprise network environment (lab02)**. all architectural decisions were validated through live engineering trials and forensic analysis.

---

## architecture suite
* [**complete-hybrid-network-lab**](./complete-hybrid-network-lab/) - technical build: infrastructure, networking, and security configurations.
* [**enterprise-design-authority**](./enterprise-design-authority/) - strategy: engineering blueprints and poc validation.
* [**packet-life-forensics**](./packet-life-forensics/) - evidence: the forensic journey and binary proof (pcaps).

---

## system integrity
audit status: evidence and configuration exports are verified and centralised within the individual lab modules.
