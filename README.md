# enterprise-hybrid-architecture-portfolio

this repository represents a **fully functional enterprise network environment (lab02)**. all architectural decisions were validated through live engineering trials and forensic analysis.

## 📊 executive presentations & slide decks
these decks synthesise the raw lab data into high-level architectural narratives for senior stakeholders.

* [**secure access fabric walkthrough (full deck)**](./complete-hybrid-network-lab/security/network-access-control/validation-proof/diagrams/Secure_Access_Fabric_Walkthrough.pdf) - *focus: zero-trust, medical device onboarding, and identity-based access.*
* [**palo alto architectural strategy**](./enterprise-design-authority/palo-alto-strategy-summary.pdf) - *focus: zone-based security, migration logic, and transit-routing.*

## architecture suite
* [**complete-hybrid-network-lab**](./complete-hybrid-network-lab/) - technical build: infrastructure, networking, and security configurations.
* [**enterprise-design-authority**](./enterprise-design-authority/) - strategy: engineering blueprints and poc validation.
* [**packet-life-forensics**](./packet-life-forensics/) - evidence: the forensic journey and binary proof (pcaps).

> **methodology note**: architectural visuals and slide evidence were synthesised by processing raw technical logs and running-configurations through **notebooklm** to ensure direct alignment with actual lab logic.
