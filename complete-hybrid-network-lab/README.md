## architecture modules
this enterprise framework is divided into three functional pillars:

* [infrastructure](./infrastructure/) - identity core, active directory, and compute foundation.
* [networking](./networking/) - azure hub-and-spoke routing and cloud gateways.
* [security](./security/) - palo alto ngfw, globalprotect, and edge enforcement.

## navigation
* [access validation-proof hub](./security/edge-protection/validation-proof/README.md)
* [back to main architecture](../../README.md)

## system integrity & verification
the contents of this report represent a fully functional, unified test environment. every component—from the azure cloud ingress to the aruba clearpass identity engine—has been confirmed as working together in a live, integrated state.
